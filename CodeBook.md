# Code book

This code book describes the variables, the data, and transformations
and work performed to clean up the data.

# Data set

The data set produced by "run_analysis.R" is "tidy.txt".

The name "tidy.txt" was chosen to assist markers to identify the
file which corresponds to step 5 of the assignment.

# Variables

tidy.txt has the following columns:

- "subject": the subject identifier
- "activity": the activity name (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
- A column for the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of the
  underlying data set, containing the mean of the measurement for each
  subject and activity.

# Code book

This code book describes the variables, the data, and transformations
and work performed to clean up the data.

# Data set

The data set produced by "run_analysis.R" is "tidy.txt".

The name "tidy.txt" was chosen to assist markers to identify the
file which corresponds to step 5 of the assignment.

# Variables

tidy.txt has the following columns:

- "subject": the subject identifier
- "activity": the activity name (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
- A column for the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of the
  underlying data set, containing the mean of the measurement for each
  subject and activity.

These variable names come from the underlying dataset, and are explained in
detail in the file "features_info.txt" which accompanies that dataset.

As the underlying variables have been normalized to the range [-1,1], these
averages also fall within this range.

With 66 variables, plus the identifying columns "subject" and "activity",
the data will have 68 columns. With 6 activities and 30 subjects, there
are 180 rows.
